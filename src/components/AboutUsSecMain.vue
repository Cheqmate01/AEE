        <img class="sm:float-left w-full sm:w-60 ml-4" src="foundation-pic-1.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The premise of Ajayi Elebire Elite was founded on the memory and life of Olalekan Ajayi's father, Babatunde
          Ajayi, a.k.a Elebire, who passed on July 18, 2020. He was born in Ekiti State, Nigeria, on July 11, 1945.
          Babatunde was a great man of God who valued his family, community, and country, being that he was a retired
          veteran of the Biafra War. Lekan's father would always say this proverb to him, "ronti OMO Eni ti iwonshe ooo,
          nitoripe Eni ti koni Eni to ma de ko kin sinwi oooo" meaning always remember the son of whom you are and that
          someone who doesn't have anyone to tie him down doesn't run mad. Before he passed away, he asked Olalekan to
          help people, so Olalekan decided to create a legacy in the name of his father that could impact many lives
          throughout the continent of Africa and the entire world.</p>

        <img class="w-full sm:w-96 ml-4 sm:float-right" src="/founder-pic-1.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Olalekan Ajayi was born on May 5, 1992, in Shomolu Local Government Lagos, Nigeria. He spent most of his life
          in Nigeria until he won a basketball scholarship in 2009 that allowed him to further his education in the
          United States. In November of that year, he began his studies and athletic career at Quality Education Academy
          of Winston Salem, North Carolina. During his four-year attendance at QEA, he accomplished a lot on the court
          and in the classroom, winning the National Christian Championship from 2009 to 2011. Mr. Ajayi became the top
          24 overall on ESPN ranking. He also became the Valedictorian of the graduating class of 2011 at QEA. After
          high school, he attended Collins College and Plato, Texas, where he was ranked top 10 junior college
          basketball player of the nation. After obtaining his associate degree in Public Relations, he became an
          Eastern Michigan University Division 1 Eagle in Ypsilanti, Michigan, becoming a two-time student-athlete of
          the year (Academic All-MAC Accolades), earning his Bachelor of Science in Communication. He also played
          basketball and received his Master's at California State University Northridge. After college, he began his
          professional basketball career overseas, playing for Albacete Basketball Club in Spain, Monestire in Tunisia,
          and Petro Atlético in Angelo. But one of Olalekan Ajayi's most significant accomplishments is playing for his
          country, becoming a player on the Senior Nigerian National team. He was awarded the Bronze medal in 2016 at
          the all-African games in the Congo Brazzaville. Olalekan Ajayi accomplished so much before the age of 30 and
          being a student-athlete gave him that opportunity. Because of this, he decided he wanted to pass the torch to
          provide the younger generation with a chance to better their life through his non-profit Ajayi Elebire Elites,
          his mentors Godwin Owinje and Masai Ujiri gave to him and others. His mission is to help change the narratives
          such as poverty, social immobility, and unemployment that exist across many societies around the world;
          Olalekan Ajayi believes we as the stewards of the village must decide if we are going to invest in the
          construction of the children or invest in the deconstruction of the adults.</p>
